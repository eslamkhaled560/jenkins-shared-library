# Description:

The Jenkins shared library encompasses three Groovy functions designed for the purpose of building and pushing a Docker image to Docker Hub. Additionally, it includes a functionality to remove the local image as part of the clean-up process.            
This shared library is primarily employed within the context of the "jenkins-shared-lib-aws-agent" project.
